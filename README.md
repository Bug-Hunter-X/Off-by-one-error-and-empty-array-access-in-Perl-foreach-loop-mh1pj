This repository demonstrates a common Perl error related to accessing array elements in a foreach loop, specifically when the array is empty. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides the corrected version.  The issue is that the loop iterates even if the array is empty, potentially causing runtime errors. The solution demonstrates safe array handling.
